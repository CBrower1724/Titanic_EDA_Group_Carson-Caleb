This file represents the in class project we worked on as a group. My partner was Caleb and we answered questions based on the Titanic data we recieved in class. The main question we were trying to answer was based on survival rate and what directly compared with survival with other features. To find out the answer we used a lot of graphs, plots, and many more within our code. Our findings were very interesting especially to see which features were directly related to the higher survival rates.
